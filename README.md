# Solutions to problems from the book Digital Dice

This repository has some solutions to problems from the book [Digital Dice: Computational Solutions to Practical Problems by Paul J. Nahin](http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Dice-Computational-Solutions-Probability/dp/0691158215)


I've only finished a couple problems, and so far have written answers in Ruby, Python, MATLAB, and Javascript.
